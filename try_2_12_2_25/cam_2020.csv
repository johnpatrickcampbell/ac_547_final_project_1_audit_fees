11080,"Uncertain tax positions","Evaluation of provisions for uncertain tax positions – Mongolian Tax Assessments
As discussed in Notes 2 and 23(b) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain tax assessments from the Mongolian Tax Authority (MTA) as a result of tax audits performed on the periods 2013-2015 and 2016-2018. A provision was not recorded for the combined amount of approximately $378 million in tax assessments, or for the impact of any reduction in available tax losses, disputed by the Company relating to those years or any additional potential assessments related to 2019 through December 31, 2020.

We identified the evaluation of provisions for uncertain tax positions pertaining to disputed tax assessments received from the MTA as a critical audit matter. A high degree of subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required in assessing the Company’s judgments relating to the application of tax law in Mongolia including possible outcomes from related arbitration proceedings.
